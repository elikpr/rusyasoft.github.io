## Main Concepts

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Bridges the gap between developers and experts
- **Bounded Context**: Clear boundaries between different parts of the system
- **Core Domain**: Focus on the most important part of the system (refer to the existing solutions for not important part of the system)


### Onion Architecture
This is the classical onion architecture, which refers that core part of the onion cannot refer to the upper layers and should be independent. While upper layers are relaying on lower layers (relaying core layer as well). Core elements of the model should act in an isolation from others.

Core part of the Onion would contain: Entities, Value Objects, Domain events and Aggregates. Next upper layer contains: Repositories, Factories and Domain Services. Application Services are located on higher level, and finally most highest layer contains UI.

### Separation of Concerns
Core layer elements carry the most important part of the application, its business logic (*not all of it of course but most part*). Entity and Value Object should do only one thing which is representing a domain objects. They should not contain and knowledge about how theya are persisting in the repository. Cleaner we keep our domain model, easier it will be reason about it.
